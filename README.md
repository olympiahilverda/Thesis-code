Title: Detecting fraud and corruption in international development projects using an automated machine learning model

Abstract: Every year, millions of dollars are lost to corruption, fraud and collusion in international development projects. This is a growing problem since prohibited conduct is becoming harder to detect and is often only discovered after the fact. Although there is immense potential, there are relatively few examples of how Artificial Intelligence can be used in anti-corruption work in development settings. This paper states that certain contract- and supplier-related factors increase the risk of corruption and could be detected early. So, this thesis develops an automatic model to detect fraud and corruption in a proactive way. Using historical data on development contracts and debarred suppliers from the World Bank, a random forest classification model automatically identifies the projects with highest risk of corruption. I find that higher contract values, competitive procurement methods as well as the extractive and transportation sectors seem to increase the risk of corruption. The model provides an early warning system and makes it possible to take preventive and corrective measures.
